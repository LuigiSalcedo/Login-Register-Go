# Login-Register-Go
A simple project about a login and register web page using Go, MySQL and JWT to manage the users.

## How to execute
If you want to execute the project you have to run the main.exe. It is compiled for Windows 64 bits.

The program needs a MySQL/MariaDB connection. Open you MySQL/MariaDB manager and create a database named **loginregister**.

With the database created you have to run the program on cmd console like this:
```
main user password
```
**user** is your database user.
**password** is your database password.

If everything went good you have to see a message: **"server running..."**

Now just open your browser on http://localhost:8080. It should show you index.html.
